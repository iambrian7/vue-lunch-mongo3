    <h1>Debt</h1>
    <h2>What is it</h2>
    <p>Debt can mean many things. It's kind of abstract. It needs some more context to give it meaning. For this discussion lets debt to mean financial debt. This would be 
      any money that you need to keep from dying. Money can be seen as income to be used to pay bills. Income is not what your hourly/monthly rate for working is or even taxable cash you recieve from any source. Money is after tax income that can be used to pay bills, food, gas, misc needs for your life.
    </p>
    <p>If your income is greater than your outflow then, in my opinion, you have no debt. You have negative debt. Negative debt is money that is saved. Some might say that if you have credit cards with a balance then you have debt. I say that you have everything you need after paying all monthly payments then you have no debt. So if you paid of all your credit cards would that mean you could do more? If so then you are saying that you don't have everything you need and to get everything you need those cards must go.</p>
    <p>If you want to retire then you income from the job will end. If it ended could you still pay the bills? Even if all your credit cards and cars and house are paid off you would still need income. You will always need to eat, buy gas, real estate taxes, entertainment, etc. So if you stop working where will the income come from? Your need for income can be seen as debt. You need income to be debt free. You will always need income to be a DebtFreeBitch. </p>
    <h2>Can it be fixed?</h2>
    <p>If we can turn our "positive debt" into "negative debt" we will need to have all accounts which have ongoing demands for money be paid off. When it comes to paying off a home mortgage it is a demand for money but it also is like a savings account. Any money over and above the interest the principle is still yours but I think maybe have the mortgage paid off is something you should do. </p>
    <p>After all bills are paid off you still need a monthly amount of income that needs paying. Being a DebtFreeBitch means you will allways have enought income to meet your needs. This could be very little or very much. It depends on the bitch. Life's a bitch. Ever hear that? That just means you always need some money and that's your bitch. </p>
    <p>Ok, how do we start fixing this? </p>
    <p>First: Go into attack mode. You will need this to overcome the fear of facing the facts. Honesty is hard. Probably the hardest thing there is in life. We know this is true because if we were capaable of being honest we would have solved this problem long before now!</p>
    <p>Attack mode means that you know the facts and have outlined a plan to pay off all debts in a shortest time possible. It also means it is now your highest priority. It is an extreme case of willingness. It is energy. It is love.</p>
    <h2>Negative Debt</h2>
    <p>Your plan is to have a visable monthly goal and focus on changing spending into mending. This goal is going to become addictive. Addictive to results. Just seeing monthly balances going down releases dopamine into your system and you will need more and more payoffs to make you happy. You are becoming a happy DebtFreeBitch! </p>
    <p>We have created a sysem to help you see your progress. First you record all financial data and once a day you can view how good it's going to get. As the months go by you will find more ways to stop wasting money and getting more income. You will develop an intuition over time if you review you plan daily, especially just before going to sleep for the night. I believe that getting good sleep helps figure out things while your sleeping.</p>
